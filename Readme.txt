This is the first project for me as a new learner of the front  ended developer;
Since it is the first try for me, the code is not so perfect, I believe that there is the more concise code and  more coding style;
For the most js part, I use the jquery grammer t0  create the function module;and in the next time, I will modify the code and make it more concise and repair the debug;
Anyway this is a local music_play, you can add your own music which have been download from the internet in that I have no access to the sever;
You can just download the music_player.html, the music_play.css, the music_play.js, the lyric_jquery.js and the music folder;
with the all work compeleted, you can enjoy the music with the browser in your PC;
